In HTML file there are
meta tags: link to font-awesome,

In CSS file we use
Lato font-type, linear-gradient for background of body,
music-container to wrap everything except of h1,
img-container for images and pseudo img-container
for a white spot inside of a song image,
music-container class 'play' to make image running with a song,

navigation bar for our prev, play and next buttons,
'music-info' class style with song title transparent and with

In JavaScript me made following functionalities:
play and pause songs using play/pause button,
change songs to previous one with prev button,
change songs to next one with next button,
showing a progress of the song on the progress bar
and possibility to start a song from different points of progress bar.
